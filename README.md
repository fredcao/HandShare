# HandShare
###### Handshare is a way to connect with people seamlessly, without losing the physical connection of a business interaction

### Required Software
---
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/)
* [Evothings Workbench](http://evothings.com/download/)
* Evothings Client App
  * [Download for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.evothings.evothingsclient&hl=en)
  * [Download for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/evothings-client/id848974292?mt=8)
* A Bluetooth connection
* An Internet connection

### Running the Application
---
#### Server and Application Setup
1. Download/clone the repository
2. Open the Evothings Workbench
3. Open up File Explorer, navigate to the directory of the downloaded/cloned repository
4. Drag the folder (HandShare) into the Evothings Workbench

#### Client Setup
1. Open the Evothings Client App
2. Press *"Scan for Workbench"*. Or, enter the *"Connect URL"* on the Evothings Workbench window into the *"Connect with address"* box. Then press *"Connect"*.

**You can have many active client connections at the same time.** In the Evothings Workbench, in the box for *"HandShare"*, press *"Run"*. All clients should then be running the application.

### Troubleshooting
---
> My Evothings Workbench crashed when I dragged the project into the window!

Try moving or copying the Evothings Studio folder into the same directory as the cloned HandShare project

> When I try to connect to the *"Connect URL"*, I get *"Webpage not available"*.

This may be a problem with your internet connection. Make sure airplane mode is turned off, and that you can connect to the internet.

> I connected my client(s) using the Evothings Client App. When I press *"Run"*, nothing shows up.

There may be a problem with the code. **Please message one of the authors or submit an issue.**
