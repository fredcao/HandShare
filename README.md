# HandShare
#### Connect with others with a simple handshake

### Required Software
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/)
* [Evothings Workbench](http://evothings.com/download/)
* Evothings Client App
  * [Download for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.evothings.evothingsclient&hl=en)
  * [Download for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/evothings-client/id848974292?mt=8)
* An internet connection

### Running the Application

#### Server and Application Setup
1. Download/clone the repository
2. Open the Evothings Workbench
3. Open up File Explorer, navigate to the directory of the downloaded/cloned repository
4. Drag the folder (HandShare) into the Evothings Workbench

### Client Setup
1. Open the Evothings Client App
2. Press "Scan for Workbench". Or, enter the "Connect URL" on the Evothings Workbench window into the "Connect with address" box. Then press "Connect".

You can have many active client connections at the same time. In the Evothings Workbench, in the box for "HandShare", press "Run". All clients should then be running the application.

### Troubleshooting
* My Evothings Workbench crashed when I dragged the project into the window!
Try moving or copying the Evothings Studio folder into the same directory as the cloned HandShare project

* When I try to connect to the "Connect URL", I get "Webpage not available"
This may be a problem with your internet connection. Make sure airplane mode is turned off, and that you can connect to the internet.

* I connected my client(s) using the Evothings Client App. When I press "Run", nothing shows up.
There may be a problem with the code. Please message one of the authors or submit an issue.
